Various filtering options provided to users: Users can filter pan-cancer triplets and synergistic pairs based on cancer type, number of cancer count, miRNA and mRNA from the left side panel.

  Figure 3. Main panel for Pan-cancer synergistic miRNA pairs. Filtering is applied with miRNAs and pairs that are common in more than 3 cancers.  

Here, users can generate interactive networks of pan-cancer miRNA pairs and triplets with network tab like in the Cancer Specific Triplets section. When user applies filtering from the left panel, the network reconstructed accordingly.
