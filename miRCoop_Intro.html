    <p align = "justify;" > <font color="#000000" face="Ubuntu" size="3"> miRCoop uses kernel-based statistical interaction tests, together with miRNA and mRNA target information to identify synergistic miRNA pairs that have weak or no repression on the target mRNA individually, but when act
together, induce strong repression. We applied our approach to patient data of various The Cancer Genome Atlas Projects(TCGA) cancer types. miRCoop web-based user interface allows users to examine the potential triplet interactions. We believe miRCoop can aid our understanding of the complex regulatory interactions in different health and disease states of the cell and can help in designing miRNA-based therapies.  </p>
